Cruder is an easy to use API to help you build your application with users registrations, login and JWT authentications in some easy steps you'll have it all configured in your localhost.  

- Clone the repository( gimme a star if you can :smile: )
- Install `Nvm` and `Yarn`.
- Enter the terminal in the repository and install all the dependencies with `yarn install`. ( it's all already configured, you just have to clone the repo and run the command )
- Afterall just run the final command `yarn dev` and you'll recieve the message: `Server listening on port http://localhost:${PORT}`
- Then you're free to use and abuse of this API, hope it's going to be usefull for you.
- ✨Magic ✨
